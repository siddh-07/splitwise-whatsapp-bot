**Splitwise WhatsApp Reminder Bot** is a Python-based automation tool that helps you recover lent money without the awkward "hey, you owe me" conversation. It connects to the Splitwise API to fetch outstanding balances and automatically sends a polite, personalized reminder to your friends via WhatsApp.

---

## 🚀 Features

-   **Real-time Balance Sync:** Fetches the most recent "You are owed" data directly from Splitwise.
-   **Automated Messaging:** Uses `pywhatkit` to automate WhatsApp Web messaging.
-   **Smart Mapping:** Maps Splitwise names to phone numbers via a configurable dictionary.
-   **Currency Aware:** Automatically detects and mentions the currency (CAD, USD, INR, etc.) of the debt.
-   **Robust Error Handling:** Includes logging and safety checks to prevent script crashes.

---

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

Before running this bot, ensure you have the following:

1.  **Python 3.8+** installed on your system.
2.  **Splitwise API Key:**
    -   Go to [Splitwise Apps](https://secure.splitwise.com/apps/new).
    -   Register a new application to get your **API Key (Personal Access Token)**.
3.  **WhatsApp Web:**
    -   You must be logged into [WhatsApp Web](https://web.whatsapp.com/) in your default browser (Chrome/Edge/Firefox).

## 📦 Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/splitwise-whatsapp-bot.git
    cd splitwise-whatsapp-bot
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Setup Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
    ```env
    SPLITWISE_API_KEY=your_actual_token_here
    ```

4.  **Configure the Phone Book:**
    Open `main.py` and update the `PHONE_BOOK` dictionary with your friends' first names and phone numbers (including country codes):
    ```python
    PHONE_BOOK = {
        "Alex": "+13479537392",
        "john": "+1234567890"
    }
    ```

---

## 🚀 Usage

Simply run the script:
```bash
python main.py
```

**Note:** The script will open a browser tab for each message. It will wait for a few seconds (default 20s) to allow WhatsApp Web to load before typing and sending the message automatically.

## 🛡️ Security Note

**Never commit your `.env` file!** This project uses `python-dotenv` to keep your API keys safe locally. The `.gitignore` file is pre-configured to ignore `.env` to prevent accidental leaks of your Splitwise credentials.

## 🗺️ Roadmap & Future Improvements

-   [ ] **Database Support:** Store phone numbers in a SQLite database instead of a hardcoded dictionary.
-   [ ] **Headless Messaging:** Integrate with the Twilio API for background messaging without opening a browser.
-   [ ] **Automatic Scheduling:** Add a feature to run the bot automatically every weekend.
-   [ ] **Multi-Currency Totaling:** Convert all debts to a base currency (like CAD) using a live exchange rate API.
